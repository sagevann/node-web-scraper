**What is made possible? **You can spark innovative action while diminishing "yes, but..." and "either-or" thinking. **Wicked Questions** engage everyone in sharper strategic thinking by revealing entangled challenges and possibilities that are not intuitively obvious. They bring to light paradoxical-yet-complementary forces that are constantly influencing behaviors and that are particularly important during change efforts. **Wicked Questions** make it possible to expose safely the tension between espoused strategies and on-the-ground circumstances and to discover the valuable strategies that lie deeply hidden in paradoxical waters.

Five Structural Elements -- Min Specs

1\. Structuring Invitation


* Ask, "What opposing-yet-complementary strategies do we need to pursue simultaneously in order to be successful?"


2\. How Space Is Arranged and Materials Needed


* Groups of 4 to 6 chairs with or without small round tables
* Paper for recording


3\. How Participation Is Distributed


* Everyone involved in the work or topic is included
* Everyone has an equal opportunity to contribute


4\. How Groups Are Configured


* Individually
* Small groups (6 people or smaller)
* Whole group


5\. Sequence of Steps and Time Allocation


* Introduce the concept of **Wicked Questions** and paradox. Illustrate with a couple of examples of **Wicked Questions**. Give the following template, "How is it that we are ... and we are ... simultaneously?" as the sentence to complete by inserting the two opposite strategies that are at play. 5 min.
* First alone then in small groups, each participant generates pairs of opposites or paradoxes at play in his or her work using the **Wicked Question** format. 5 min.
* Each group selects its most impactful and wicked Wicked Question. All selected Wicked Questions are shared with the whole group. 5 min.
* Whole group picks out the most powerful ones and further refines the Wicked Questions. 10 min.


WHY? Purposes


* Describe the messy reality of the situation while engaging collective imagination
* Develop innovative strategies to move forward
* Avoid wild or "bipolar" swings in policy and action
* Evaluate decisions: Are we advancing one side or the other or attending to both?
* Ignite creative tension, promoting more freedom and accountability as the discovery process unfolds


Tips and Traps


* Make sure that participants express both sides of the paradox in an appreciative form: "How is it that we are \_\_\_\_ and we are \_\_\_\_ simultaneously?" and not in opposition of each other
* Use a variety of examples to make the paradoxical attributes accessible
* Work in quick cycles, failing forward as you make the questions perfectly wicked
* Avoid nasty questions that appoint blame or are unbalanced on one side. Here is an example of a nasty question: "How can we focus on our customers when we are forced to spend more and more time on the headquarters' bureaucracy?"
* Avoid data questions that can be answered with more analysis
* Invite participants to include others in making their questions more wicked
* Draw on field experience; ask, "When have you noticed these two things to be true at the same time?"
* There are no quick fixes to Wicked Questions and you may need to return to the challenge periodically with additional rounds of Wicked Questions
* Often a handful of people are very skilled at generating Wicked Questions: let them shine and inspire the rest of the group!


Riffs and Variations


* Use Wicked Questions to evaluate and launch Improv Prototyping, Ecocycle, and 25/10 Crowd Sourcing
* When you have a strong Wicked Question, don't stop there! Follow with 15% Solutions and 1-2-4-All to generate and sift ideas. Making progress on any one Wicked Question can shift what is possible.

Examples


* For parenting advice: "How is it that you are raising your children to be very loyal/attached to the family and very independent individuals simultaneously?"
* For helping leaders discover how to include everyone in stopping infections: "As infection-control leaders, how is that you have stepped up and stepped back to help a unit take more ownership of prevention practices?"
* For managing large global operations: "How is that we are always and never the same... an organization with a singular global identity and we are uniquely adapted to each local setting? How is it that we are integrated and autonomous?"
* For a functional department, such as HR, finance, legal, etc., to bring to light the Wicked Questions that capture the essence of the function in the context of the department's organization
* For surfacing personal Wicked Questions, for instance, with respect to one's relationship to one other person or in connection to a personal challenge. For instance, "How is it that I am simultaneously dedicated to my work and being fully present for my family?"
