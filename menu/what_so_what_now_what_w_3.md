Together, Look Back on Progress to Date and Decide What Adjustments Are Needed (45 min.)

**What is made possible? **You can help groups reflect on a shared experience in a way that builds understanding and spurs coordinated action while avoiding unproductive conflict. It is possible for every voice to be heard while simultaneously sifting for insights and shaping new direction. Progressing in stages makes this practical---from collecting facts about _What Happened_ to making sense of these facts with _So What_ and finally to what actions logically follow with _Now What_. The shared progression eliminates most of the misunderstandings that otherwise fuel disagreements about what to do. Voila!

Five Structural Elements -- Min Specs

1\. Structuring Invitation


* After a shared experience, ask, "WHAT? What happened? What did you notice, what facts or observations stood out?" Then, after all the salient observations have been collected, ask, "SO WHAT? Why is that important? What patterns or conclusions are emerging? What hypotheses can you make?" Then, after the sense making is over, ask, "NOW WHAT? What actions make sense?"


2\. How Space Is Arranged and Materials Needed


* Unlimited number of groups
* Chairs for people to sit in small groups of 5-7; small tables are optional
* Paper to make lists
* Flip chart may be needed with a large group to collect answers


3\. How Participation Is Distributed


* Everyone is included
* Everyone has an equal opportunity to contribute at each table


4\. How Groups Are Configured


* Individuals
* Groups of 5-7
* Whole group
* Groups can be established teams or mixed groups


5\. Sequence of Steps and Time Allocation


* If needed, describe the sequence of steps and show the Ladder of Inference (see below). If the group is 10--12 people or smaller, conduct the debrief with the whole group. Otherwise, break the group into small groups.
* First stage: WHAT? Individuals work 1 min. alone on "What happened? What did you notice, what facts or observations stood out?" then 2--7 min. in small group. 3--8 min. total.
* Salient facts from small groups are shared with the whole group and collected. 2--3 min.
* If needed, remind participants about what is included in the SO WHAT? question.
* Second stage: SO WHAT? People work 1 min alone on "Why is that important? What patterns or conclusions are emerging? What hypotheses can I/we make?" then 2--7 min. in small group. 3--8 min. total.
* Salient patterns, hypotheses, and conclusions from small groups are shared with the whole group and collected. 2--5 min.
* Third stage: NOW WHAT? Participants work 1 min. alone on "Now what? What actions make sense?" then 2--7 min. in small group. 3--8 min. total.
* Actions are shared with the whole group, discussed, and collected. Additional insights are invited. 2--10 min.




#### **WHY? Purposes**


* Build shared understanding of how people develop different perspectives, ideas, and rationales for actions and decisions
* Make sure that learning is generated from shared experiences: no feedback = no learning
* Avoid repeating the same mistakes or dysfunctions over and over
* Avoid arguments about actions based on lack of clarity about facts or their interpretation
* Eliminate the tendency to jump prematurely to action, leaving people behind
* Get all the data and observations out on the table first thing for everyone to start on the same page
* Honor the history and the novelty of what is unfolding
* Build trust and reduce fear by learning together at each step of a shared experience
* Make sense of complex challenges in a way that unleashes action
* Experience how questions are more powerful than answers because they invite active exploration


Tips and Traps


* Practice, practice, practice ... then **What, So What, Now What?** will feel like breathing
* Check with small groups to clarify appropriate answers to each question (some groups get confused about what fits in each category) and share examples of answers with the whole group if needed
* Intervene quickly and clearly when someone jumps up the Ladder of Inference
* Appreciate candid feedback and recognize it
* Build in time for the debrief---don't trivialize it, don't rush it
* Make it the norm to debrief with **W3**, however quickly, at the end of everything


Riffs and Variations


* For the What? question, spend time sifting items that arise into three categories: facts with evidence, shared observations, and opinions
* Add a What If? question between So What? and Now What?
* For the So What? Question, sift items into patterns, conclusions, hypotheses/educated guesses, beliefs


Examples


* For drawing out the history and meaning of the events prior to your gathering, start a meeting with **W³**
* For debriefing any meeting topic that generates complex or controversial responses
* For groups with people who have strong opinions or individuals who dominate the conversation
* For groups with people who have difficulty listening to others with different backgrounds
* For use in place of a leader "telling" people what to think, what conclusions to draw, or what actions to take (often unintentionally)
* As a standard discipline at the end of all meetings
* Right after a shocking event

Chris Argyris introduced the "Ladder of Inference" in _Reasoning, Learning, and Action: Individual and Organizational_ (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 1982).
