**Engage Everyone in Making Sense of Profound Challenges (35-60 min.)**

**What is made possible? **You can include and engage any number of people in making sense of confusing or shocking events and laying the ground for new strategies to emerge. The format of the **Conversation Café** helps people have calm and profound conversations in which there is less debating and arguing, and more listening. Sitting in a circle with a simple set of agreements and a talking object, small groups will engage in rounds of dialogue with little or no unproductive conflict. As the meaning of their challenge pops into focus, a consensual hunch is formed that will release their capacity for new action.

Five Structural Elements -- Min Specs

1\. Structuring Invitation




2\. How Space Is Arranged and Materials Needed


* Unlimited number of 5 to 7 chairs around small tables
* Markers and one or two pieces of flip-chart paper per table optional


3\. How Participation Is Distributed


* Everyone is included
* Everyone has an equal opportunity to contribute


4\. How Groups Are Configured


* Mixed, diverse groups of 5--7 participants


5\. Sequence of Steps and Time Allocation


* State the theme of the conversation, usually in the form of a question
* Distribute the talking objects


WHY? Purposes


* Make sense of a complex, difficult, or painful situation and lay the ground for being able to move on
* Generate new ideas and momentum for innovation
* Build shared understanding of how people develop different perspectives and ideas
* Avoid arguments based on lack of understanding
* Build trust and reduce fear with an opportunity for catharsis
* Help participants appreciate that conversation involves talking and listening


Tips and Traps


* Always use the talking object: they make the difference
* Have the host or participants reread the six agreements before starting the first round
* Do not assign tasks: there should be no intention that the dialogue will directly lead to action
* Host the dialogue like a dinner party, encouraging everyone to contribute while keeping the conversation open-ended and spontaneous
* Use [Wicked Questions][0] to deepen conversation
* If there is a problem, ask, "Are we following our agreements?"
* Encourage people to speak their mind
* Encourage quiet people to talk
* Select talking objects that may have symbolic meaning for participants
* Encourage participants to draw or record insights on the flip-chart "tablecloth"

Examples


* For making sense of and start recovering from a major setback or shock in the market or operating environment (e.g., first used in US communities after 9/11)
* For exploring a new topic or trend that is not well understood
* For handling a topic where there will be strong feelings expressed
* For reflecting after a major change: What does it mean? What assumptions can we make? What conclusions make sense? What can we now believe?
