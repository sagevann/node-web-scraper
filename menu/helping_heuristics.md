Practice Progressive Methods for Helping Others, Receiving Help and Asking for Help (15 min.)

You cannot help a man permanently by doing for them something they could and should do for themselves. -- Abraham Lincoln

**What is made possible? **Participants can gain insight into their own pattern of interaction and habits. **Helping Heuristics** make it possible for them to experience how they can choose to change how they work with others by using a progression of practical methods. Heuristics are shortcuts that help people identify what is important when entering a new situation. They help them develop deeper insight into their own interaction patterns and make smarter decisions quickly. A series of short exchanges reveals heuristics or simple rules of thumb for productive helping. Try them out!

Five Structural Elements -- Min Specs

1\. Structuring Invitation


* Invite participants to view all human interactions as offers that are either accepted or blocked (e.g., Improv artists are trained to accept all offers)
* Ask them to act, react, or observe four patterns of interaction
* Invite them to reflect on their patterns as well as to consider shifting how they ask, offer, and receive help


2\. How Space Is Arranged and Materials Needed


* Any number of participants, standing
* No tables in the way of people standing face-to-face!


3\. How Participation Is Distributed


* Everyone has an equal opportunity to learn and to contribute
* Participants switch into one of three possible roles as the activity progresses


4\. How Groups Are Configured


* Groups of 3: two participants interacting face-to-face in the roles of client and coach plus one observer
* Whole group for the debrief


5\. Sequence of Steps and Time Allocation


* Explain that there will be four rounds of 1--2-minute improvised interactions. Groups choose one member to be a "client," another a "coach," with the third acting as "observer." Roles can stay the same or change from round to round. The fourth round will be followed by 5 minutes of debrief. 2 min.
* During every round the person in the role of client shares a challenge he or she is passionate about. While the observer pays close attention, the coach responds in a sequence of patterns that is different for each round as follows.
* During the first round, the response pattern is "Quiet Presence": the coach accepts all offers with compassionate listening \[see the Liberating Structure [Heard, Seen, Respected (HSR)][0]\]. 2 min.
* During the second round, the response pattern is "Guided Discovery": the coach accepts all offers, guiding inquiry for mutual discoveries (see the Liberating Structure [Appreciative Interview][1]). 2 min.
* During the third round, the response pattern is "Loving Provocation": the coach interjects advice, accepting and blocking as needed when the coach sees something that the client does not see (see the Liberating Structure [Troika Consulting][2]). 2 min.
* During the fourth round, the response pattern is "Process Mindfulness": the coach and client accept all offers from each other, working at the top of their intelligence while noticing how novel possibilities are amplified. 2 min.
* Debrief the impact of all four helping patterns as experienced by clients, coaches, and observers. 5 min.
* Based on the debrief, repeat all rounds or only some for all participants to practice various response patterns.


WHY? Purposes


* Reduce/eliminate common errors and traps when people are giving or asking for help
* Change unwanted _giving help_ patterns that include: premature solutions; unneeded advice; adding pressure to force use of advice; moving to next steps too quickly; trying too hard not to overhelp
* Change unwanted _asking for help_ patterns that include: mistrusting; not sharing real problem; accepting help without ownership; looking for validation, not help; resenting not getting enough


Tips and Traps


* Encourage people to change roles in each round
* Develop trust, inquire humbly, create climate of mutual discovery
* Focus on patterns that will help _the client_ finding his or her own solutions (self-discovery in a group)
* Do not ignore status differences, the setting, body language, demeanor, subtle signals
* The first cycle of four rounds can be used as preparation for deeper work on any single pattern
* After initial cycle, let trios choose the patterns they want to focus on in their group


Riffs and Variations


* Invite participants to create their own profile, self-identifying their default patterns and opportunities for growth
* Incorporate the helping progression into other Liberating Structures that focus on give-and-take: **[Troika Consulting][2], **[Wise Crowds][3], [What I Need From You][4], [Improv Prototyping][5], [Simple Ethnography][6]
* Start with "fun" patterns: neutral (zero response) and blocking by ignoring or interrupting


Examples


* Used when **Wise Crowds** or **What I Need From You** does not achieve a group's intended purpose---for example, when participants have fallen into one of the unwanted _asking for_ or _giving help_ patterns
* For nurses, coaches, teachers, or anyone else in the helping professions to renew and learn new relational skills
* For any group working to improve interprofessional coordination
* For Liberating Structures facilitators to dig deeper into underlying patterns that cut across many Liberating Structures
* For expanding options when frustrated with trying to help another person
