Five conventional structures guide the way we organize routine interactions and how groups work together: presentations, managed discussions, open discussions, status reports and brainstorm sessions. Liberating Structures **add 33 more options** to the big five conventional approaches.

The menu below represents version 2.2 of Liberating Structures.  If you are new to LS, we recommend that you start practicing with the simplest (e.g., [1-2-4-All][0], [Impromptu Networking][1]), starting from the top left and moving to the most intricate at the bottom right ([Panarchy][2], [Purpose-To-Practice][3]). The more intricate methods use many of the simpler LS as building blocks. Read [Microstructures & Design Elements][4] to learn more about how they work.   **Click on any Liberating Structure below.**
