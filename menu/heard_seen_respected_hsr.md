Practice Deeper Listening and Empathy with Colleagues (35 min.)

Empathy removes the blocks to action in a way that is inclusive. It creates power through partnership and cocreation, resolving what appears to be knotted and bound. -- Dominic Barter

**What is made possible? **You can foster the empathetic capacity of participants to "walk in the shoes" of others. Many situations do not have immediate answers or clear resolutions. Recognizing these situations and responding with empathy can improve the "cultural climate" and build trust among group members. **HSR** helps individuals learn to respond in ways that do not overpromise or overcontrol. It helps members of a group notice unwanted patterns and work together on shifting to more productive interactions. Participants experience the practice of more compassion and the benefits it engenders.

Five Structural Elements -- Min Specs

1\. Structuring Invitation


* Invite participants to tell a story to a partner about a time when they felt that they were not heard, seen, or respected.
* Ask the listeners to avoid any interruptions other than asking questions like "What else?" or "What happened next?"


2\. How Space Is Arranged and Materials Needed


* Chairs facing each other, a few inches between knees
* No tables


3\. How Participation Is Distributed


* Everyone has an equal amount of time, in turn, to participate in each role, as a storyteller and a listener


4\. How Groups Are Configured


* In pairs for the storytelling
* Then foursomes for reflecting on what happened


5\. Sequence of Steps and Time Allocation


* Introduce the purpose of **HSR**: to practice listening without trying to fix anything or make any judgments. 3 min.


WHY? Purposes


* Reveal how common it is for people to experience not being heard, seen, or respected
* Reveal how common it is for people to behave in a way that makes other people feel they are not being heard, seen, or respected
* Improve listening, tuning, and empathy among group members
* Notice how much can be accomplished simply by listening
* Rely on each other more when facing confusing or new situations
* Offer catharsis and healing after strains in relationships
* Help managers discern when listening is more effective than trying to solve a problem


Tips and Traps (for introducing HSR)




Riffs and Variations


* If you are feeling brave, replace the word "respected" with "loved" (i.e., the _agape_ form of love---seeking the highest good in others without motive for personal gain.)
* String **HSR** together with other Liberating Structures that help to mend relationships: [Troika Consulting][0], [Helping Heuristics][1], [Generative Relationships STAR][2], [Appreciative Interviews][3], [Conversation Caf√©][4]


Examples


* For regular meetings to improve the quality of listening and tuning in to each other
* For transition periods when questions about the future are unanswerable (e.g., post-merger integration, market disruptions, social upheaval) and empathetic listening is what is needed
* When individuals or groups have suffered a loss and need a forum to share their grief or despair
* To improve one-on-one reporting relationships up and down in an organization
